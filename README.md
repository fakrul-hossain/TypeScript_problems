# What Are Some Differences Between Interfaces and Types in TypeScript?

If you're learning TypeScript, chances are you've come across both `interface` and `type`. They seem similar at first, right? They both let you describe the shape of data—like objects, function signatures, or even complex structures. But once you dig in, you’ll notice some key differences that can affect how you write and organize your code.

So, let’s break it down in simple terms—what are the actual differences between `interface` and `type` in TypeScript, and when should you use one over the other?

---

## 🔹 1. Both Can Describe Object Shapes — But There’s More

Let’s start with what they have in common: both `interface` and `type` can be used to define the structure of an object.

Here’s how they look:

```ts
// Using interface
interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

// Using type
type User = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};
```

Looks pretty much the same, right? And in this simple case, they behave the same too.

But `type` can do more than just define object shapes…

---

## 🔸 2. `type` Can Handle More Complex Types

Want to create a union of string literals or a tuple? `type` has your back.

```ts
type Status = "active" | "inactive" | "pending";

type Point = [number, number];
```

Try doing that with `interface`, and TypeScript won’t be happy.

👉 **Tip:** If you need to describe something that isn’t just an object (like a union, tuple, or primitive), go with `type`.

---

## 🔹 3. Interfaces Can Merge – Types Cannot

This is something a lot of beginners miss. Interfaces in TypeScript support **declaration merging**—basically, you can define an interface more than once and TypeScript will combine them.

```ts
interface Person {
  name: string;
}

interface Person {
  age: number;
}

// Now 'Person' has both name and age!
```

But if you try to do that with a `type`, TypeScript throws an error.

```ts
type Person = {
  name: string;
};

type Person = {
  age: number;
}; // ❌ Error: Duplicate identifier
```

👉 **Tip:** If you expect your type to be extended or reopened later (especially in libraries), interfaces are a safer bet.

---

## 🔸 4. Extending Types and Interfaces

Both `interface` and `type` can be extended—but they do it differently.

**With interface:**

```ts
interface Animal {
  species: string;
}

interface Dog extends Animal {
  breed: string;
}
```

**With type:**

```ts
type Animal = {
  species: string;
};

type Dog = Animal & {
  breed: string;
};
```

The result is the same—you get a type that includes both `species` and `breed`.

👉 **Tip:** Use `extends` with interfaces and `&` (intersection) with types.

---

## 🔹 5. Style and Community Preference

This one’s more about developer preference than rules.

* If you’re working in an object-oriented style or using classes, `interface` tends to fit better.
* If your types are complex and involve unions or compositions, `type` often feels more natural.

Many teams use both, and that's okay! The key is consistency.

---

## 🧠 So, When Should You Use What?

Here’s a quick cheat sheet:

| Use This When...                             | Use `interface` | Use `type` |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ---------- |
| Defining object shapes or class structures   | ✅               | ✅          |
| Creating union or intersection types         | ❌               | ✅          |
| You want to extend or merge types later      | ✅               | ❌          |
| Working with tuples or primitives            | ❌               | ✅          |
| You prefer more readable, semantic structure | ✅               | —          |

---

## 🏁 Final Thoughts

At the end of the day, both `type` and `interface` help you write cleaner, more maintainable TypeScript code. Don’t overthink it—pick the one that fits your use case best.

If you're still unsure, a good general rule is:

> 🔹 Use `interface` for object structures
> 🔸 Use `type` for everything else

That’s it! Keep practicing, and you’ll get a natural feel for when to use each.

# What is the Use of the `keyof` Keyword in TypeScript?

TypeScript is a powerful language that builds on JavaScript by adding static types. One of its useful features is the `keyof` keyword. If you're new to TypeScript, the `keyof` keyword might seem confusing at first, but it plays an important role when working with types, especially when creating generic and reusable functions.

### What is `keyof`?

The `keyof` keyword is used to get a union of all the keys of a given object type. In simpler terms, it lets you extract the property names of a type as a type themselves.

### Basic Example

```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  location: string;
}

// Using keyof
type PersonKeys = keyof Person; // "name" | "age" | "location"
```

Here, `PersonKeys` becomes a type that can only be either "name", "age", or "location". It's like saying: "Give me a type that only allows the keys from the Person interface."

### Why is `keyof` Useful?

The `keyof` keyword is useful when you want to create flexible and type-safe code. For example, you can create a function that gets a property from an object, and you want TypeScript to ensure that only valid property names can be passed.

### Practical Example

```typescript
function getProperty<T, K extends keyof T>(obj: T, key: K): T[K] {
  return obj[key];
}

const person: Person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  location: "New York"
};

const personName = getProperty(person, "name"); // OK
const personAge = getProperty(person, "age"); // OK
// const invalid = getProperty(person, "email"); // Error: Argument of type '"email"' is not assignable
```

In this example:

* `T` is the type of the object
* `K` is restricted to the keys of `T`
* `T[K]` means the type of the value at that key

This ensures that you can’t accidentally access a property that doesn’t exist on the object.

### Conclusion

The `keyof` keyword in TypeScript is a simple yet powerful tool. It helps you write safer, more flexible code by allowing you to reference the property names of types. Once you understand how it works, you'll find many situations where it makes your code cleaner and more maintainable.

Whether you’re working on a large-scale application or just starting out with TypeScript, mastering `keyof` can take your type-safety to the next level.
